    <h3> Key Notes</h3>
    <ul class="notes">
        <li> A variable is like a container. It's purpose is to hold a value or piece of information for you. </li>
        <li> The most basic declaration is using the keyword "var" like <span class="example-code">var example = "Hello!";</span></li>
        <li> Certainly you can give your variable any name, as long you don't use JS keywords or special characters. Avoid using numbers at the beginning too! (Ex: <span class="example-code">var 1nameOfVar = 0;</span> would be a invalid variable declaration)</li>
        <li> Sometimes, you will have the need to have data that is strictly no neeeded to change and stay constant in the whole execution of the code. Then you can use a constant, like <span class="example-code"> const R = 3.1415;</span></li>
        <li> In a way, there are variables that only exist or can be only used in a single block code, and here it enters in game the keyword <span class="example-code">let</span>.
             in fact, is suggested to declare your variables using that keyword rather than using <span class="example-code">var</span>. Because sometimes you can forgot about a variable, and later
             it can give you some confusion or errors do the lack of context that <span class="example-code">var</span> can be capable. (See <span class="demo-link" onclick="demo1();">Demo 1</span>). 
             For example in the following code, you see that we create a variable using the <span class="example-code">let</span> keyword in the for loop block code. if you try to use that variable later after that block of code, you can see the variable doesn't exist anymore:
                <pre class="example-code">
                    for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
                        console.log(i); //output = numbers between 0 and 9
                    }
                      console.log(i); //error i is undefined, it means it doesnt exist outside the block where was created                
                </pre>
             if you create a for loop block code using the <span class="example-code">var</span> keyword, then you can see that after that mentioned code block, you can still use that same variable and it even mantains the same last value that it got assigned!:
                <pre class="example-code">
                    for(var z=0; z < 10; z++) {
                        console.log(z);
                    }
                
                    console.log(typeof(z)); //z is defined as number. So it became global as soon we created it as "var" and available everywhere!
                </pre>
        </li>
        <li> So, basically the difference between <span class="example-code">let</span> and <span class="example-code">var</span> is the <span class="keyword">hoisting</span>. <span class="example-code">var</span> hoist the variable and <span class="example-code">let</span> not, this means that,
             wherever you declare a <span class="example-code">var</span>, this will be hoisted to the top, it will be a global variable automatically and accessible from everywhere; 
             and this doesn't happens with <span class="example-code">let</span>. At first glance, one can would think that "wow, var is easier to use!" but realistically, this in bigger codes can be rather problematic, as
             there are a lot of functions and variables in game!
             Thus, is very suggested and encouraged to use the keyword <span class="example-code">let</span> in projects.</li> 
        <li> You can use Strict Mode to use a more strict JavaScript for your projects using the line <span class="example-code">use strict;</span> Using strict mode ensures that the browser will execute your code in the most efficient way possible and give you the most amount of feedback when errors occur. 
            for example, it practically obligates you to declare your variables properly. Like for example in non-strict mode, you can declare a variable by just writing <span class="example-code">x = 0;</span> and no using keywords. In Strict Mode, this would throw an error. 
        </li>
    </ul>
